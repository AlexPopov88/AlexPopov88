# 🧪 Python HSE Demo Test

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook was created as a **demo test** for Python and data analytics skills, showcasing practical use of Python for solving typical data-related tasks. The test covers a mix of **data manipulation, statistics, logic implementation**, and **output formatting**, demonstrating proficiency in working with structured data using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform data extraction and transformation
- Apply conditional logic and rule-based classification
- Analyse data with descriptive statistics and correlation
- Use efficient data handling with pandas
- Validate outputs using consistent structures

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** — for data handling
- **numpy** — for mathematical operations
- **openpyxl** — for Excel export (if used)
- **Jupyter Notebook** — for structured analysis and outputs

---

## 📊 Statistical Analysis

The project includes several **descriptive and exploratory statistics techniques**, such as:

- `mean()` — to calculate average values across numeric columns
- `std()` — to measure variability and standard deviation
- `corr()` — to detect correlation between features
- `describe()` — for a full summary (count, mean, min, max, quartiles)
- Grouped aggregations using `.groupby()` and `.agg()` for segmented insights

These methods help uncover patterns, variability, and relationships within the dataset, supporting data-driven conclusions.
