## üßæ Data Source

The dataset was sourced from **[Kaggle - Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)**. It includes 30 users' physical activity, sleep, and heart rate data collected over a 31-day period.

| üìÅ File | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| dailyActivity_merged.csv | Steps, distance, intensity and calories burned |
| hourlySteps_merged.csv | Hourly step count |
| heartrate_seconds_merged.csv | Second-level heart rate data |
| sleepDay_merged.csv | Sleep duration and quality |
| weightLogInfo_merged.csv | Weight, BMI logs |
| ...and more |

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Dataset is limited to one month in Spring 2016 and has only 30 participants.

## üßπ Data Cleaning

- Cleaned using **Excel** (datetime formats, delimiters, duplicates).
- Converted CSVs to `.xlsx`, fixed column types and formulas.
- Used **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** for aggregation and visualisation.
- Created daily aggregates and merged multiple datasets by `Id` and `Date`.

## üìà Key Insights

1. **Step Tracking & Sedentary Behaviour**  
   - Users with >1000 sedentary minutes showed inverse correlation with daily steps.  
   - Bellabeat devices can nudge users to increase daily steps and reduce sedentary time.

2. **Calories Burned & Activity Levels**  
   - Calories burned showed strongest correlation with *Very Active Minutes*.  
   - Devices can visualise activity-effort-reward patterns for better motivation.

3. **METs (Metabolic Equivalent of Task)**  
   - METs are strongly correlated with very active minutes.  
   - Could be used to personalise fitness recommendations.

4. **Sleep Tracking**  
   - Strong correlation between time in bed and minutes asleep.  
   - Devices can help improve sleep quality with insights and alerts.

5. **Limited Weight/BMI Data**  
   - Only 8 users logged weight. Suggests low usage or difficulty with manual entry.

## üìä Visualisations

- Scatter plots to show step count vs. activity minutes  
- Correlation heatmaps for calories, METs, and sleep metrics  
- Segmentation based on sedentary time
